# Instructor notebooks

Instructor notebooks are runnable notebooks that are compatible with either
Jupyter and Colab and contain the source code of both the material for students
as well as quizzes and quiz autochecking tests.

See https://github.com/google/prog-edu-assistant/blob/main/exercises/README.md
for the description of the format.
